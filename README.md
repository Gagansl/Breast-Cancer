#Breast Cancer

#Overview

This project focuses on breast cancer detection and classification using machine learning techniques. It aims to assist medical professionals by providing an automated system to analyze and predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on input data.

#Objectives

Develop a model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant.

Provide a user-friendly interface for data input and predictions.

Ensure the model is interpretable and reliable for medical use.

#Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains:

569 samples of breast tumor data.

30 features derived from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

Labels: Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

#Features:

Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

Compactness

Concavity

Concave points

Symmetry

Fractal dimension

Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, etc.

Steps Involved

#Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset.

Handle missing values and normalize data.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions and relationships between features.

Identify important features using correlation analysis.

#Model Training:

Train multiple machine learning models.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

#Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Compare model performance.

Deployment (optional):

Build a Flask web application for user interaction.

#Results

Achieved an accuracy of 85% using the Random Forest Classifier.

The model successfully identifies malignant and benign cases with high precision and recall.

Usage

Future Enhancements

Integrate deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

Extend the model to classify other types of cancers.

Incorporate real-world clinical data for validation.
